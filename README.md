**ðŸ“ˆ Monte Carlo & Black-Scholes Option Pricing Simulator**
A comprehensive Python tool for pricing European call and put options using both Monte Carlo simulations and the Black-Scholes-Merton analytical model. This project helps visualize stock price distributions at maturity using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and provides an intuitive comparison between theoretical and empirical option pricing methods.

ðŸ§  **Overview**
Option pricing is central to quantitative finance and risk management. This project simulates the movement of stock prices over time using Geometric Brownian Motion, calculates option values through:

Monte Carlo methods (numerical simulations)

Black-Scholes formula (closed-form solution)

It also includes:

A visual plot of stock price outcomes at maturity.

A side-by-side numerical comparison of Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes prices.

ðŸš€ **Features**

âœ… Simulates terminal stock prices using Geometric Brownian Motion.

âœ… Prices European call and put options using Monte Carlo simulation.

âœ… Computes theoretical prices using the Black-Scholes formula.

âœ… Visualizes the distribution of simulated stock prices.

âœ… Compares Monte Carlo estimates with Black-Scholes values.
